Hello, my name is Salvatore, and welcome to my GitHub.

After having a degree in Law and working in that field for four years, I decided to change my career and pursue my passion for software development. 

I moved to Madrid from Sicily and enrolled in 42 school. 

I enjoy coding in different languages and I'm always looking for different and better ways to achieve results and solve problems.

I'm an enthusiast of data-driven solutions.

My other passions are:
:brain: neuroscience
:books: philosophy
:deciduous_tree: environmental protections
:lotus_position_man: meditation
